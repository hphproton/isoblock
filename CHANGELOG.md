# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Test fixture `crowd`: 200 objects with locks and provisional values, for the stage 2 editor.

## 0.1.0

Stage 1: schema, projection, geometry, checks, SVG render, CLI.

### Added

- Scene format `isoblock/1`: JSON Schema in `schema/isoblock-1.json`. Unknown keys are errors; `x-` keys are allowed. For checks the stage does not implement, only `id` and `check` are validated.
- Reference checks: duplicate ids, unknown object types, relation targets (`zone:`, `lane:`, `strip:<id>.v0|v1`), check parameters that name missing things, states that hide missing objects, assumption paths that do not resolve.
- Projection, inverse projection and camera direction, matching `tests/golden/projection.json`.
- Object geometry: footprints, 90-degree rotation about the footprint center, parts.
- Checks `in_region`, `no_overlap`, `clearance`, `lane_clear`, `lane_reaches` and `visible`, as defined in SPEC 9.1. Checks not implemented in this stage, unsupported lane shapes and the `top` and `bottom` edges return `skip`.
- Display list (ground, objects in painter's order, region outlines, labels) and SVG output.
- `describe` (SPEC Appendix B).
- CLI `validate`, `check` (text and `--json`), `render` (`-o out.svg`) and `describe`, with the exit codes of SPEC section 11. Commands and flags of later stages exit 2 and name the stage that adds them.
- `npm run build` bundles the CLI into `dist/isoblock.mjs`.
- `docs/AGENT_GUIDE.md`: install, the four commands, how to read `describe`, check reference.
